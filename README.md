# 🌟 Problem - 3 (Refactor Code)

## 📝 Task Description
The task was to refactor the provided codebase to make it more maintainable, organized, and readable without changing its functionality. The main objective was to restructure the logic while ensuring clean and reusable code practices.

## 🔧 What I’ve Done
1. **Separated Logic**: 
   - Moved the `renderContent` function from `button.js` to a new file called `utilsFunc.js` for better modularity and separation of concerns.

2. **Centralized Styles**:
   - Created a `styles.js` file to store all button styles (`primary` and `secondary`), making the code cleaner and ensuring easy updates to styles in the future.

3. **Simplified Conditions**:
   - Combined conditions for variants like `'icon-arrow-primary'` and `'primary'` into a single block to reduce redundancy.
   - Similar refactoring was applied to `'icon-arrow-secondary'` and `'secondary'`.

4. **Enhanced Readability**:
   - Added clear and meaningful comments to explain the changes made and the purpose behind them.

## 📌 Note
I’ve included comments in the code to explain the changes and refactoring decisions made for better understanding.
